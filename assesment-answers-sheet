Assesment Answers Sheet
Part A
    1. With minimal possible layers to install Web Services and expose appropriate http port for accessing:

        1. Created a nodejs app, opened a port and run it from our machine
        2. Exposed a port 8080
        3. When we build the image we use 
        “docker build -t appnode:1.0 -f Dockerfile .”
        When we run the image , we map the port with 8080 in our local machine.
        “docker run -d -p 8090:8080 appnode:1.0”

        gitURL: git@github.com:gokulreddy07/docker-wipro.git

    2. Docker Container is not Starting
        
          1. port is already in use
          2. no required permissions to the repo
          3. Docker daemon is not running
          4. no space left in device
          5. docker image not found with specific tag
          6. conatiner with that name already exist

PART B
    1.Using shell command search for a particular pattern (of your choice) to search Docker logs using awk command
        docker logs <containername> | grep <content> | awk '{print $1}' 

    2. Execute a shell command inside a container to search for a file.
        
       syntax: “docker exec –it <container name> find / -name <filename>”
       example: "docker exec -it appnode find / -name package.json"
       

JENKINS
PART A
    1. There is a Jenkins pipeline failure the failure error at the outset suggest that build has failed and one of the tool used for the build is running inside the container – what are the commands you will use for debugging the issue

        1. docker stats <containerId> --> when we are using any metrics, and they show how the error occured
        2. docker logs -f <containerId> --> basic command which shows all i/p o/p and errors of a container
        3. docker exec -it <containerId> sh --> go inside a container and debug
        4. docker commit <containerId> my-container && docker run -it my-container /bin/bash --> if we cant really start a container

    2. There is a build failure due to connectivity issue with one of the tools – what actions you will take to narrow down the issue.
        
         1. check the authentication configuration to it (with credentials)
         2. reset the credentials in mananger (secretkey or username and passoword)
         3. check the api working status
         4. if it is in ssh, configure the ssh-key connectiviy


    3. Why Docker Push fails?

         1. you may missed the docker login
         2. check the docker hub url
         3. check image is created with specified tagging or not
         4. check docker login credentials 
         5. check the image name, we shoudl add the docker hub id and repo to that
         6. check docker daemon is running or not

    4. Write a shell script to setup git repo, docker build, push image to docker repository.
        Clone the shell script and give executable permissions to the file
        The repository in github: https://github.com/gokulreddy07/docker-wipro/blob/main/docker.sh
        Give chmod +x <filename> to execute a shellscript.
